node.js - the good, the bad and the ugly

or:

node.js - bringing event-driven programming to the masses since 2009

Ben does a retrospective on node.js:

 * how and why did node.js get to be?
 * what has happened along the way?
 * where are we going?

He then goes on to discuss - possibly in minute detail - the ups and downs of
programming the node.js way.

 * what problems does node.js solve or try to solve?
   - how?
   - why like that and not some other way?

 * what problems does it *not* solve?
   - can not solve?
   - does not want to solve?

 * what problems does it introduce?
   - why?
   - how do we overcome them? do we overcome them?

 * what are node's main competitors and how does it hold up to them?
   - similarities and differences between node.js and erlang/otp, twisted,
     golang, boost.asio, etc.
   - comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the languages
     and frameworks mentioned above, no holds barred, no feelings spared

So many questions! And, time permitting, they will all be answered.
